== Time-Lapse


The following section describes all the functionality that is available as it relates to the time-lapse menu.


=== Delete Frame
Kick that image to the curb and remove it from the stack.

TIP: Get rid of things even faster by using the delete button on the keyboard.

=== Enable Rotation
When rotation is enabled (anti-nausea medicine sold separately), panning is disabled and vice versa.

=== Geo-Jump
Go to any place on the map that your heart desires.

=== Reverse Order
The default order of the image stack is chronological. But, if you prefer the other way, here's where to do it. 

TIP: If you prefer chronological order all the time, you can use `chronological=false` in the URL.
